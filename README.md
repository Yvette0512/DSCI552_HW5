Decision Trees as Interpretable Models
(a) Download the Accute Inflamations data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ ml/datasets/Acute+Inflammations.
(b) Build a decision tree on the whole data set and plot it.1
(c) Convert the decision rules into a set of IF-THEN rules.2
(d) Use cost-complexity pruning to find a minimal decision tree and a set of decision rules with high interpretability.
